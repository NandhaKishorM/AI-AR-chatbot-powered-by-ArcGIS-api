# Inspiration
The inspiration comes after traveling to one of the unknown towns and got some serious fever during the journey, it was very difficult to find the nearby hospital in the night, since no people were outside at that time. Since then I was so determined to make an app that can help me to find nearby services including hospitals, hotels, grocery stores, ATMs, etc.

# What it does
The app can help you to find the best services within a close location and minimal travel distance considering real-time traffic. identify the travel cost by getting the real-time travel time between your service and desired places, and also helps to start a new business considering its weights in that area.

# How we built it
We built it using ArcGIS API, AWS EC2, Flask RESTful API, AWS dynamodb, AWS Lambda, AWS Sumerian, AWS Lex
## AWS Lambda function and app 
The function and app can be found on the lambda_function directory and app directory.

# Challenges we ran into
Integrating the AR with an audio chatbot is a tough job and also integrating various processes of ArcGIS API is also a harder job.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
